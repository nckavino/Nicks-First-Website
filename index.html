        <p id="bio">Hello! My name is Nick, and as you might have gueesed by now, this is my first website.
            I am so happy that you came here to check this out. I graduated high school in 2013 and since then
            I have spent my time studying and working. Recently I have decided to join FlatIron for software Engineering.
            I am very excited to see where this new path bigs me.
        </p>
